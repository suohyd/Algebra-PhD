    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with unity. Then <m>R</m> can be considered a right <m>R</m>-module using the multiplication in ring <m>R</m>. With this considerations, <m>R</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra.

    <statement>
        <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is a ring (not necessarily commutative), and let <m>Z(A)</m> be the center of <m>A</m>. Then <m>A</m> is a <m>Z(A)</m>-algebra.

    <statement>
        <p>
            Suppose that <m>R</m> is a commutative ring and <m>n</m> is a positive integer. Then the ring of <m>n\times n</m> matrices over <m>A</m>, denoted by <m>M_n(A)</m>, is an <m>A</m>-algebra.
